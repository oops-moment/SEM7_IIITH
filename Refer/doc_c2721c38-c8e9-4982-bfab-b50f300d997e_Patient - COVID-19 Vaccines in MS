Overall, the rates of adverse reactions in this study were similar to what has been reported in other studies of people without MS who received the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, the rates of relapses were similar in the patients in this study compared with non- vaccinated MS patients in the past.",

  "context": "Certain types of immune cells, like B cells and T cells, are available to fight viral infections.13 Based on how Ocrevus works (effects on certain B cells), there may be an impact on your body\u2019s ability to respond to a vaccine.2,14 Ocrevus does not appear to have an effect on most T cells.15.\nEarly reports suggest that there is a lessened antibody response after a COVID-19 vaccine in patients who are treated with Ocrevus.16-18 Some evidence suggests that the longer interval from the last infusion of Ocrevus may lead to a greater antibody response, but more studies are needed to establish that.\nAdditionally, some reports have evaluated T cell responses to COVID-19 vaccines, and have found that patients who are treated with Ocrevus develop a similar T cell response as other patients not treated with medications.16,17 There is some early evidence that T cells may provide some protective immunity to the COVID-19, but more studies are required.\nMore studies are required (and currently underway) to better understand the important roles that B cells and T cells play in the body's response to COVID-19 vaccines, and how this translates to future protection against COVID-19.\nThe National MS Society (NMSS) website has some information on the potential effects on some MS treatments on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, they discuss whether antibody tests should or should not be used to determine immunity or protection against COVID-19 after infection or after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine:\nhttps://www.nationalmssociety.org/coronavirus-covid-19-information/multiple-sclerosis- and-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-guidance/Vaccine-Effectiveness-and-MS",
