Change In Cash,: Cash Equ, ivalents and Res, tricted Cash
Our Cash and cash: equivalents, at December 31, 2, 022 totaled $2, .6 billion, a $3, 16 million decre, ase compar, ed to D, ecember 31,
2021, primarily as a: result of the, factors discussed, above.
Restricted cash at: December 3, 1, 2022 totaled $1.5, billion, a $266, million increa, se compared to, restricted ca, sh at D, ecember 31,
2021, primarily rela: ted to cash, collections on cert, ain receivables, that are requ, ired at certain s, pecified tim, es to be, placed into
segregated accoun: ts. The incr, ease was primarily, driven by the c, ompletion of, asset-backed d, ebt transacti, ons dur, ing the year
ended December 3: 1, 2022.
Free cash flow is a: non-GAAP, financial measure t, hat reflects an, additional wa, y of viewing our, liquidity tha, t, we b, elieve, when
viewed with our G: AAP results, , provides manage, ment, investor, s and other, users of our fin, ancial infor, mation, with a more
complete understa: nding of fac, tors and trends aff, ecting our cas, h flows. Free, cash flow is c, alculated by, subtra, cting capital
expenditures (inclu: ding capitaliz, ed software) from n, et cash provid, ed by operatin, g activities. We, believe it is, a more, conservative
measure of cash flo: w since cap, ital expenditures ar, e necessary for, ongoing oper, ations. Free ca, sh flow has li, mitatio, ns due to the
fact that it does not: represent t, he residual cash flo, w available for, discretionary, expenditures. F, or example,, free ca, sh flow does
not incorporate pay: ments mad, e on finance lease, obligations or c, ash payment, s for business a, cquisitions, or wirel, ess licenses.
Therefore, we belie: ve it is impor, tant to view free ca, sh flow as a co, mplement to o, ur entire consoli, dated statem, ents of, cash flows.
The following table: reconciles n, et cash provided by, operating activ, ities to free ca, sh flow:
Years Ended Dece: mber 31,, 20, 22, 2021
Net cash provided: by operating, activities, $ 37,1, 41 $, 39,539
Less Capital expen: ditures (incl, uding capitalized so, ftware), 23,0, 87, 20,286
Free cash flow: $ 14,0, 54 $, 19,253
The decrease in fr: ee cash flow, during 2022 is a r, eflection of the, decrease in, operating cash f, lows, as we, ll as th, e increase in
capital expenditure: s, both of wh, ich are discussed a, bove.
