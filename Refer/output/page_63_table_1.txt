We record prope: rty, plant and eq, uipment at cost., Property,, plant and equ, ipment are ge, nerally deprec, iated on a, straight-line
Leasehold improv: ements are amo, rtized over the sh, orter of t, he estimated li, fe of the impro, vement or th, e remaining, term of the

When depreciable: assets are retire, d or otherwise di, sposed of, , the related co, st and accumu, lated depreci, ation are de, ducted from

We capitalize and: depreciate netw, ork software pur, chased or, developed wi, thin property, p, lant and equi, pment ass, ets. We also

We capitalize the: cost of internal-, use network and, non-netw, ork software a, nd defer the co, sts associate, d with clou, d computing

software mainten: ance and training, costs for internal-, use softw, are and cloud, computing arra, ngements are, expensed, in the period
in which they are: incurred. We c, apitalize interest, associate, d with the dev, elopment of in, ternal-use ne, twork and, non-network

Goodwill and O: ther Intangibl, e Assets
Goodwill is the ex: cess of the acqui, sition cost of busi, nesses o, ver the fair valu, e of the identifi, able net asse, ts acquired, . Impairment
testing for goodwi: ll is performed an, nually in the fourt, h quarter, or more freque, ntly if impairme, nt indicators a, re present, .
To determine if go: odwill is potentia, lly impaired, we h, ave the o, ption to perfor, m a qualitative, assessment., However, w, e may elect
to bypass the qua: litative assessm, ent and perform a, quantitat, ive impairment, test even if no, indications o, f a potentia, l impairment
exist. It is our poli: cy to perform qua, ntitative impairme, nt assess, ment at least, every three yea, rs.
Under the qualitat: ive assessment,, we consider seve, ral factor, s, including the, business ente, rprise value o, f the report, ing unit from
the last quantitati: ve test and the, excess of fair val, ue over c, arrying value f, rom this test,, macroeconom, ic conditio, ns (including
