internal and external dat: a sources. If a, Consumer c, ustome, r has been a c, ustomer less than 45, days, or a, Business c, ustomer has
been a customer for les: s than 12 mon, ths, the cust, omer is, considered a, "short-tenured custo, mer." For sh, ort-tenured, customers,
the credit decision and c: redit monitorin, g processes, rely m, ore heavily on e, xternal data sources, .
Available external credit: data from cre, dit reporting, agencie, s along with in, ternal data are used, to create c, ustom credi, t risk scores
for Consumer custome: rs. The custo, m credit risk, score, is generated, automatically from, the applic, ant’s credit, data using
proprietary custom credi: t models. The, credit risk sc, ore me, asures the like, lihood that the poten, tial custom, er will beco, me severely
delinquent and be disco: nnected for n, on-payment., For a s, mall portion of, short-tenured custo, mer applicat, ions, a trad, itional credit
report is not available fr: om one of the, national cred, it repor, ting agencies, because the potentia, l customer, does not ha, ve sufficient
credit history. In those in: stances, alter, native credit, data is, used for the ri, sk assessment. For, Business cu, stomers, w, e also verify
the existence of the busi: ness with exte, rnal data sou, rces.
Based on the custom cr: edit risk score, , we assign e, ach cu, stomer a credit, class, each of which, has specif, ied offers o, f credit. This
includes an account lev: el spending l, imit and a m, aximum, amount of cr, edit allowed per de, vice for Con, sumer cus, tomers or a
