Capital Expend: itures and Investmen, ts
We continue to: invest in our wireless, networks, h, igh-speed f, iber and other adva, nced tec, hnologies to p, osition ourse, lves at the

Global Netwo: rk and Technology
We are focusing: our capital spending, on adding c, apacity and, density to our 4G, Long-Ter, m Evolution (L, TE) network,, while also
building our nex: t generation 5G netwo, rk. We are, densifying o, ur networks by utili, zing sma, ll cell technolo, gy, in-buildin, g solutions
and distributed: antenna systems. N, etwork den, sification e, nables us to add, capacity, to address in, creasing m, obile video
consumption an: d the growing deman, d for IoT pro, ducts and, services on our 4G, LTE and, 5G networks, . Over the p, ast several
years, we have: been leading the dev, elopment of, 5G wireles, s technology indust, ry standa, rds and the e, cosystems fo, r fixed and
mobile 5G wirel: ess services. 5G techn, ology enabl, es higher th, roughput and lower, latency th, an the 4G LT, E technology, and allows
our networks to: handle more traffic as, the number, of internet-c, onnected devices g, rows. In, January 2022,, we began d, eploying C-
Band spectrum,: which has been built, out to cove, r approxim, ately 189 million PO, Ps in the, U.S. as of D, ecember 31, , 2022. We
expect to conti: nue deploying C-Ban, d spectrum, across the, continental U.S. a, s more, and more of, the spectrum, becomes
available for our: use. We use low and, mid-band s, pectrum an, d dynamic spectrum, sharing (, DSS) technol, ogy, to allow, 5G service
to run simultan: eously with 4G LTE, on multiple, spectrum, bands. With DSS,, wheneve, r customers, move outsid, e Verizon’s
millimeter wave: and C-Band coverage, areas, thei, r 5G-enable, d devices will rema, in on 5G, technology u, sing the lowe, r spectrum
bands where thi: s network is available., This allows, us to more, fully and effectively, utilize ou, r current spec, trum resourc, es to serve
both 4G and 5G: customers.
To compensate: for the shrinking ma, rket for tra, ditional cop, per-based product, s, we co, ntinue to buil, d fiber-base, d networks
