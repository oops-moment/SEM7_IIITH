The following di: scussion of "R, isk Factors" id, entifies fa, ctors that m, ay adversely aff, ect our busin, ess, opera, tions, financial

discussion of ris: ks is not all-inc, lusive but is d, esigned to, highlight wh, at we believe are, the material, factors to, consider when
evaluating our b: usiness and ex, pectations. Th, ese factors, could cause, our future result, s to differ mat, erially fro, m our historical
results and from: expectations ref, lected in forwa, rd-looking, statements.

We face signif: icant competi, tion that ma, y reduce, our profits, .
We face signific: ant competition, in our indust, ries. The, rapid develo, pment of new tec, hnologies, se, rvices and, products has
eliminated many: of the traditio, nal distinctions, among w, ireless, cabl, e, internet and lo, cal and long, distance, communication
services and bro: ught new compe, titors to our m, arkets, incl, uding other te, lecommunication, s companies, c, able comp, anies, wireless
service providers: , satellite provi, ders, technolo, gy compan, ies and appl, ication and device, providers. W, hile these, changes have
enabled us to off: er new types of, products and s, ervices, th, ey have also, allowed other pro, viders to broad, en the sco, pe of their own
competitive offeri: ngs. If we are u, nable to compe, te effectiv, ely, we could, experience lower t, han expected, revenues, and earnings.
Wireless service: providers are si, gnificantly alter, ing the fin, ancial relation, ships with their cu, stomers throu, gh comme, rcial offers that
vary service and: device pricing,, promotions, in, centives a, nd levels of s, ervice provided –, in some cases, specifical, ly targeting our
customers and p: utting pressure, on pricing and, margins. I, n addition, the, wireless industry, ’s customer gr, owth rate, could moderate
in comparison to: historical grow, th rates, leadin, g to incre, ased compet, ition for customer, s. Our ability t, o compete, effectively will
depend on, amo: ng other things,, our network qu, ality, capa, city and cove, rage, the pricing o, f our products, and servi, ces, the quality
of our customer: service, our dev, elopment of n, ew and en, hanced prod, ucts and services,, the reach an, d quality o, f our sales and
distribution chan: nels, our ability, to market our, products a, nd services e, ffectively and our, capital resourc, es. It will, also depend on
how successfully: we anticipate a, nd respond to, various fa, ctors affectin, g our industries, in, cluding new te, chnologie, s and business
models, change: s in consumer, preferences a, nd deman, d for existin, g services, demo, graphic trends, and evol, ving economic
conditions, inclu: ding inflation. I, f we are not, able to re, spond succe, ssfully to these, competitive c, hallenges,, our results of
operations and f: inancial conditio, n could be ad, versely im, pacted. In ad, dition, a projected, sustained de, cline in a, reporting unit's
revenues and ea: rnings could ha, ve a significant, negative i, mpact on its f, air value and resu, lt in an impair, ment char, ge, which could
