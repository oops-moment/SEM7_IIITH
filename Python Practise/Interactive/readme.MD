Global Startup Name Validator

Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a Global Startup Name Validator for a platform that helps entrepreneurs register new company names across multiple countries. Similar to existing platforms, the system needs to ensure that no two companies are registered with names that are too similar, to avoid confusion or legal issues. However, different countries have specific rules for validating company names.

Your Task
Implement the function validate_name_availability, which takes in a list of account IDs and corresponding company name requests.
For each requested company name, determine whether it is Name Available or Name Not Available, based on the following conditions:
The first instance of a valid name should be marked as available, and subsequent instances of similar names should be marked as unavailable.
Once a name is marked as unavailable, it cannot be registered by another company.
Name Comparison Rules
Names do not have to be identical to be considered the same. Apply the following rules to determine if two company names are similar:

Case Insensitivity: 
- Ignore differences in case, e.g., "Innovate Tech" is the same as "INNOVATE TECH".
- Special Characters: Treat characters like commas (,), periods (.), ampersands (&), and hyphens (-) as spaces. For example, "Innovate-Tech LLC" is the same as "Innovate Tech Inc."
- Multiple Spaces: Treat multiple consecutive spaces as a single space.
- Ignored Words: Ignore leading articles such as "The", "A", and "An" (e.g., "The Global Enterprise" is the same as "Global Enterprise").
- Country-Specific Suffixes: Suffixes that denote legal structures (like "Inc.", "Ltd.", "GmbH", "S.A.", etc.) should be ignored in the comparison. Assume suffixes can be from a list: ["Inc.", "Corp.", "Ltd.", "LLC", "GmbH", "S.A.", "Pty Ltd", "L.L.C."].
- Numerical Names: Names with numbers at the end, like "Tech Solutions 123" and "Tech Solutions", should be considered distinct unless the numbers refer to the year of foundation (e.g., "Tech Solutions 2020" and "Tech Solutions 2021" are distinct).
- Abbreviations: Common abbreviations should be expanded and compared. For example, "Co." should be treated as "Company", and "Intl." as "International".
Name Collapse: After applying the transformations, if the resulting name is empty or contains only spaces, it should be considered not available.
Input
Each input will represent a name availability check with an account ID (e.g., acct_abc123) and a proposed company name, separated by a | (pipe) character.

Output
For each company name request, print a line with the account ID, followed by a pipe (|), followed by either Name Available or Name Not Available, based on the availability of the name.

Additional Considerations
Names from different countries may still conflict if they follow the same rules. The validator should handle these conflicts globally, across all countries.
A name that is marked as unavailable should not be considered available for any future request.
Example 1 - Single Entry
Input:

Copy code
acct_00123|Innovate Tech Inc.
Output:

Copy code
acct_00123|Name Available
Explanation: The name "Innovate Tech Inc." is available and marked as such.

Example 2 - Matching Entries
Input:

Copy code
acct_00123|Innovate Tech Inc.
acct_00567|INNOVATE-TECH LTD.
Output:

mathematica
Copy code
acct_00123|Name Available
acct_00567|Name Not Available
Explanation: The names "Innovate Tech Inc." and "INNOVATE-TECH LTD." are considered the same after applying the transformation rules. The second request is unavailable.

Example 3 - Multiple Suffixes and Articles
Input:

sql
Copy code
acct_00123|The Global Company Inc.
acct_00567|Global Company Ltd.
acct_00987|Global Company International LLC.
Output:

mathematica
Copy code
acct_00123|Name Available
acct_00567|Name Not Available
acct_00987|Name Not Available
Explanation: All names are considered too similar after ignoring leading articles and suffixes, so only the first name is marked available.

Example 4 - Name Collapse
Input:

Copy code
acct_00123|The, Inc.
acct_00567|The Tech, LLC.
Output:

mathematica
Copy code
acct_00123|Name Not Available
acct_00567|Name Available
Explanation: "The, Inc." collapses to an empty name after ignoring the article "The" and suffix "Inc.", making it unavailable. "The Tech, LLC." becomes "Tech", which is valid and available.

Example 5 - Numerical Distinction
Input:

yaml
Copy code
acct_00123|Tech Solutions 2020 Inc.
acct_00567|Tech Solutions 2021 LLC.
Output:

Copy code
acct_00123|Name Available
acct_00567|Name Available
Explanation: The names "Tech Solutions 2020" and "Tech Solutions 2021" are considered distinct due to the different numerical endings, so both are available.

Good luck!

This new variant includes additional checks for country-specific suffixes, number handling, and abbreviation expansions. It will provide a more comprehensive challenge!
